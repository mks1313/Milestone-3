# Milestone-3 Repository at Campus 42 Barcelona

Welcome to my **Milestone-3** repository at **Campus 42 Barcelona**! This repository showcases the projects I have worked on during this milestone, focusing on advanced algorithms, concurrency, and Unix-based systems. Here, I am working on **Philosophers** and **Minishell**, two essential projects in my journey towards mastering C programming and system-level programming.

## Current Projects

### 1. **Philosophers**
**Philosophers** is a project where I implement a solution to the classic "Dining Philosophers" problem, which is a synchronization problem involving multiple processes (or threads) sharing limited resources. In this project, I used **pthreads** to simulate multiple philosophers sitting at a table and trying to eat without causing deadlock. The challenge lies in ensuring that all philosophers can eat without any of them being stuck forever (deadlock) or starving.

This project significantly deepened my understanding of **concurrency**, **multithreading**, and **synchronization techniques**. It helped me improve my skills in managing multiple threads safely and efficiently, as well as handling shared resources in a multithreaded environment.

### 2. **Minishell**
**Minishell** is a project where I build a simple shell program, similar to the Unix shell, which handles user input and executes commands in a terminal. The goal is to implement basic functionalities such as command parsing, redirection, piping, and background process execution. Through this project, I gain deeper insight into how Unix shells work, including **process management**, **system calls**, and **input/output redirection**.

This project enhanced my understanding of **system programming**, **process forking**, and working with system calls like `execve`, `fork`, and `waitpid`. I also learned how to implement a simple but functional shell that interacts directly with the operating system.
